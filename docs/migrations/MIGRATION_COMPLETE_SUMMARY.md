# ✅ Personnel Management Dashboard - Real Data Migration COMPLETE

## 🎉 Migration Successfully Completed!

The Personnel Management Dashboard has been successfully migrated from mock data to use the real Personnel database that was seeded during the Personnel Dashboard implementation.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Removed Mock Database Dependencies**
- ❌ Deleted `src/lib/mockDb.ts` (no longer needed)
- ✅ Updated all imports to use real database functions
- ✅ Fixed the departments API route that was causing the build error

### 2. **Updated All API Routes**
- ✅ **Personnel API** (`/api/admin/personnel`) - Working with real MongoDB data
- ✅ **Analytics API** (`/api/admin/analytics`) - Real-time calculations from database
- ✅ **Departments API** (`/api/admin/departments`) - Derived from Personnel collection

### 3. **Database Integration Verified**
- ✅ MongoDB connection working correctly
- ✅ Personnel collection has 3 seeded records
- ✅ All APIs returning real data from database

## 🧪 Testing Results
